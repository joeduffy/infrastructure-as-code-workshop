# Configuring Azure

Now that you have a basic project, let's configure Azure support for it.

## Step 1 &mdash; Install the Azure Package

Run the following command to install the Azure package:

```bash
dotnet add package Pulumi.Azure --version 1.14.0-preview
```

*Note: Pulumi .NET SDK is still in preview, so we need to specify the NuGet package version explicitly.*

The package will be added to `csproj` and the binaries will be restored.

## Step 2 &mdash; Use the Azure Package

Now that the Azure package is installed, add the following line to `MyStack.cs` to import it:

```cs
...
using Azure = Pulumi.Azure;
...
```

> :white_check_mark: After this change, your `MyStack.cs` should [look like this](./code/02-configuring-azure/step2.cs).

## Step 3 &mdash; Configure an Azure Region

Configure the Azure region you would like to deploy to:

```bash
pulumi config set azure:location westus2
```

Feel free to choose any Azure region that supports the services used in these labs ([see this infographic](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) for a list of available regions).

## Step 4 &mdash; Login to Azure

Simply login to the Azure CLI and Pulumi will automatically use your credentials:

```
az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code XXXFAKEXXX to authenticate.
```

The Azure CLI, and thus Pulumi, will use the Default Subscription by default, however it is possible to override the subscription, by simply setting your subscription ID to the id output from `az account list`â€™s output:

```
$ az account list
```

Pick out the `<id>` from the list and run:

```
$ az account set --subscription=<id>
```
